# First iteration ui sketches and flows

Starting at a landing page or home page and briefly running through some rough interactions.

## Home/landing/launch page
In addition to the app shell, the home page has a page header and grid of photo thumbs, the first of which, is an add a new person. The thumbs have an eye icon and a number next to them indicating the number of people that have seen the individual. The heading says something to the effect of, "Have you seen me?" The grid is sorted in ascending order by number of people that have seen someone. The add new person takes you through the add person flow.
