## git stuff

  - master branch needs to be deployable
  - integration is the dev melting pot where all the stuff gets pr'd to
  - features and fixes need to correspond with issue numbers
  - ideation is a separate branch for stories and wireframey type assets
  - checks and reviews ideally before integration and definatly before master
