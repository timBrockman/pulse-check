Find out if a friend or family member is ok. 

The purpose of this web-app is to allow communities in crisis to help identify people not in danger without, compromising the privacy or security of those community members. In crisis situations it is natural to worry about friends and family that may be effected. If we can enable communities to alleviate concern over those uneffected, we can free more time to focus on those effected by the crisis. We can also establish a points of official contact for those effected.

## How it works:
  1. Sign in.
  2. Enter the name of a friend you are woried about.
  3. Upload a small photo of the friend.
  4. Enter the area or city you expect them to be.
  5. When someone sees them, they enter the time they saw them and if they are safe.
